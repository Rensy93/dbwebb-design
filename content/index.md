Hi, my name is Rasmus Flomén. I was born and raised in a village called Oxie just outside Malmo, Sweden. I played hockey
 goalie for Malmo Redhawks when I was a kid/teenager. I also started skateboarding around 2006 which I’m still doing to 
 this day. But I also tried a lot of other sports a kid/teenager such as sledge hockey, sailing, football, 
 American football and floorball.

I moved to Karlskrona, Blekinge, Sweden in 2016 to study a preparation year at Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH). 
After that, I continued my studies at BTH by studying software engineering. My software engineering studies 
were completed in June 2020. But becurse of the end of the world I failed in getting a job. This led to me continuing
 my studies but this time I studied web programming at BTH.
